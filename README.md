I have wrote a Java implementation of the eertree, focused on readibility over space and time complexity optimization, since there are already fast C++ implementations around but they are not so friendly to someone who is trying to first approach the algorithm.

I also wrote an article about it here: http://alessio.engineer/eertree-or-palindromic-tree/eertree-or-palindromic-tree.html
